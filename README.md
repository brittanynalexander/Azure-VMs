Before we can create our VM we first have to create a Resource group, which you can have multiple of. Think of Resource groups as folders to store the resources you create such as VMs, Databases, Storage accounts, etc. From your Azure portal you can either click on the Resource groups icon or simply search "Resource groups" in the search bar then click create. With that being said, let's create one. Scroll with me!

After filling in various details click "Review + create" to make sure everything entered is acceptable. You can double check this action by simply going to the Resource group section. (Remeber you can click the icon or search for it.) Your section won't be empty anymore! Now that we have our resource group, let's get to creating our VM. Scroll with me!

<p>
While creating our VM there are other properties being simultaneously created as well such as a virtual network. You can compare a virtual network to a switch, which is a device used to connect devices that are on the same network. So instead of using a physical device, your virtual network or "switch" being used, works in the cloud.
